# ZKP: Web Resources

Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are a powerful cryptographic technique that enables one party to demonstrate knowledge of specific information to another party without revealing the actual information. This cryptographic concept holds substantial potential to disrupt various sectors, such as finance, healthcare, and voting.
