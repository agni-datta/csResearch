# Multiparty Computation References

## References

- **[CMSC 858K - Introduction to Secure Computation Fall 2013](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/gradcrypto2/f13/scribes.html):** These are the Lecture Notes and References for the course “Introduction to Secure Computation” offered at the University of Waterloo during the Fall of 2013. The course likely covers various aspects of secure computation and cryptographic protocols.
- **[ePrint papers](https://guutboy.github.io/):** This is a frequently updated list of secure computation papers that appear on the IACR (International Association for Cryptologic Research) electronic print. The ePrint archive is a renowned platform for researchers to share their latest work in cryptography and secure computation.
- **[Awesome MPC](https://github.com/rdragos/awesome-mpc):** This is an Awesome List repository specifically curated for MPC (Multi-Party Computation). It contains a collection of different papers, resources, and workshop listings related to secure multiparty computation. The list is likely to be a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in the field of MPC.
- **[Resources for Getting Started with MPC](https://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~lindell/MPC-resources.html):** This is a guide provided by Yehuda Lindell, offering information on how one can get started with MPC (secure multiparty computation). It serves as a helpful resource for individuals who are new to the topic and are looking for introductory materials and references to begin their journey in secure computation.
