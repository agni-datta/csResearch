# CS Research Repository

A comprehensive collection of research papers, notes, and resources in theoretical computer science and cryptography. This repository serves as a centralized hub for managing research activities, organizing academic papers, and maintaining an extensive bibliography across multiple research areas.

## 📚 Research Areas

### 🔐 Cryptography & Security

- **[Zero-Knowledge Proofs](zero-knowledge-proofs/)** - Interactive proofs, SNARKs, STARKs, and related protocols
- **[Public Key Cryptography](public-key-cryptography/)** - Digital signatures, encryption schemes, and foundational papers
- **[Multi-Party Computation](multi-party-computation/)** - Secure computation protocols and applications
- **[Rational Proofs](rational-proofs/)** - Delegation protocols and rational verifier models
- **[Fine-Grained Cryptography](fine-grained-cryptography/)** - Cryptography based on fine-grained complexity assumptions

### ⚛️ Quantum Computing & Post-Quantum Cryptography

- **[Quantum Cryptography](quantum-cryptography/)** - Quantum-resistant algorithms, lattice-based cryptography, and quantum key distribution

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each research area follows a consistent structure:

```
research-area/
├── Papers/           # Academic papers and publications
├── Notes/            # Personal research notes and summaries
├── References/       # Additional resources and references
└── references.bib    # BibTeX bibliography file
```

## 🎯 Key Features
